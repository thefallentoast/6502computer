# BitSimple-8
The BitSimple-8 is a W65C02S-based computer inspired on the Commander X16 (or X16) by Commander Computers, LLC.\
The name was suggested by @Toboter in the X16 discord so we went with it.

# Important information
The VERA module is open-source available and designed by Frank Van de Hoef. The board follows rev.4's connection scheme.\
The PCB is slightly modified to remove the X16 logo (since this isn't the X16).
